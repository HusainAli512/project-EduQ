## 🛠️ Quickstart Guide

### Step 1: Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pinecone API Key
- Gemini API Key

### Step 2: Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MHusainAli/project-elysium.git
   cd project-elysium
## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Input Your Query**: Type in any question through the Streamlit UI.
2. **Similarity Search**: Pinecone, as a vector database, performs a similarity search on stored embeddings to find contextually relevant information.
3. **AI-Driven Answer Generation**: The Gemini flash model uses the retrieved data to craft a contextual answer.
4. **Instant Results**: The system displays your answer instantly on the Streamlit interface.
